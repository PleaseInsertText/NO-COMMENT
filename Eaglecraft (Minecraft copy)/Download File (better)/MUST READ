This file is not by me, also I had to change the name so that the file would not be blocked but it is still the same.
When you download the file, click on it and then just click on the file.

If this file does not work (as in needing an update, it will tell you to compile it or something, just leave it) I will switch it out, sorry if this causes inconvenience.
